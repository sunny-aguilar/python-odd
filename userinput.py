# user input practice

# simple user input
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print(f"Hello {name}!")

# int() for converting string to integer
# age = input("What is your age? ")
# age = int(age)
# if age > 25:
#     print("welcome adult!")

# while loops
# counter = 0;
# while counter < 5:
#     print(counter, " loop")
#     counter += 1

# while loops to keep program running
